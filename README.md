**NEW: Join our community on Discord at [discord.gg/J3W9b5AZJR](https://discord.gg/J3W9b5AZJR) — protocol questions, feedback, and SDK-contribution chat all welcome.**

**Tesseron is an accessibility layer for AI agents.** You instrument your app once — the way you'd add ARIA to a web page — and any MCP-compatible agent can drive it through typed actions *you* define. Think of it as an API for agents, written by the people who built the app.

The premise: the agent doesn't need to click a button, it needs to *do the thing the button does*. Say an agent wants to add five items to a list. Through the UI that's click **add**, type, submit, click **add** again — five round-trips through a brittle, re-render-happy interface. With Tesseron it calls one action:

```ts
addTodos(['buy milk', 'finish report', 'call mom', 'book flight', 'water plants'])
```

Your handler runs against your real state. No clicking, no scraping, no brittleness.

Live applications (browser tabs, Electron/Tauri desktop apps, Node daemons, CLIs) declare actions with a Zod-style builder; agents (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Copilot, Codex, Cline, ...) call them as MCP tools. Your real handler runs in your real process, against your real state. **No browser automation, no scraping, no Playwright.**

> **It's a protocol, not just a TypeScript library — and not just for the web.** The JS/TS SDKs are the reference implementation and already cover the browser, Node, and desktop (Electron/Tauri). But the wire protocol is [CC BY 4.0](#license) and language-agnostic: anything that can open a WebSocket and speak JSON-RPC 2.0 can host actions, so a Python daemon, a Rust desktop app, or a .NET line-of-business tool can speak it too. Web is simply where the first SDKs landed — not the boundary of what Tesseron is.

WebMCP is a useful browser-native path for public sites that want an assistant to fill forms. The [Tesseron and WebMCP](https://tesseron-dev.github.io/tesseron/overview/why/#5-tesseron-and-webmcp) section explains the difference, including Tauri and Python processes, cross-app flows, and agents like Claude Code.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/diagrams/pieces-fit-together.png" alt="USER prompts the agent; YOUR APP (browser or Node, using @tesseron/web or /server) opens a loopback WebSocket and announces itself; the MCP GATEWAY (@tesseron/mcp) discovers it via ~/.tesseron/instances/ and dials in; the gateway bridges to the MCP CLIENT (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Cursor, Claude Desktop, ...) over stdio." width="900">
</p>

## Why Tesseron

- **Typed actions, not scraped DOMs.** Declare with Zod or any [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev) validator; the handler is a plain function against your real state.
- **Framework-agnostic.** Same API for vanilla TS, React, Svelte, Vue, and Node. Pick your stack.
- **MCP-native.** Every action, resource, and capability maps to a standard MCP primitive. Users pick their agent.
- **Click-to-connect.** Six-character claim code handshake. No API keys, no OAuth dance, no per-client configuration.
- **First-class capabilities.** `ctx.confirm` for yes/no, `ctx.elicit` for schema-validated prompts, `ctx.sample` for agent LLM calls, `ctx.progress` for streaming updates, subscribable resources for live reads.
- **Cross-client delivery.** First-class install paths for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi — each one a single command or short config snippet that wires the [MCP gateway](./gateway) in. No bundled binary; the gateway is `npx -y @tesseron/mcp@<version>` on demand.

## Install

Tesseron has first-class install paths for four agent clients. Pick the one you use:

### Claude Code

```text
/plugin marketplace add tesseron-dev/tesseron
/plugin install tesseron@tesseron
```

Installs the [`tesseron`](./plugin) Claude Code plugin. The MCP gateway and docs server are launched on demand via `npx`.

### Codex CLI

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add tesseron-dev/tesseron
```

Codex consumes the same plugin manifest as Claude Code, so the gateway, docs server, and skills come along automatically.

### Pi

Pi has no built-in MCP support, but the community-maintained [`pi-mcp-adapter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-mcp-adapter) is the canonical bridge. Install it once:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-mcp-adapter
```

Then add Tesseron to `.mcp.json` in your project root (or `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json` for a global install):

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tesseron": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@tesseron/mcp@2.10.5"] },
    "tesseron-docs": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@tesseron/docs-mcp@2.10.8"] }
  }
}
```

`pi-mcp-adapter` discovers and exposes the Tesseron tools to Pi automatically. Use `"directTools": true` per server entry to surface each Tesseron action as a top-level Pi tool instead of going through the `mcp` proxy.

To pick up the skill bundle as well, point Pi's settings `skills` array at a clone of [`plugin/skills/`](./plugin/skills) — the same folder Claude Code / Codex use.

### OpenCode

OpenCode reads MCP servers from `opencode.json` rather than a plugin manifest. Save this as `.opencode/opencode.json` in your project root (or `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` for global use):

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "tesseron": { "type": "local", "command": ["npx", "-y", "@tesseron/mcp@2.10.5"], "enabled": true },
    "tesseron-docs": { "type": "local", "command": ["npx", "-y", "@tesseron/docs-mcp@2.10.8"], "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

To also pick up the skill bundle, point OpenCode's `skills.paths` at a clone of [`plugin/skills/`](./plugin/skills) — see [`plugin/README.md`](./plugin/README.md#opencode) for the snippet.

### Other MCP clients

Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, Cline, and any other MCP-compatible client work too — the gateway is plain stdio MCP. See the one-time setup in [`examples/README.md`](https://github.com/tesseron-dev/tesseron-typescript/tree/main/examples/README.md#2-wire-the-mcp-gateway-into-your-mcp-client).

### Then in your app

Drop [`@tesseron/web`](https://github.com/tesseron-dev/tesseron-typescript/tree/main/web), [`@tesseron/server`](https://github.com/tesseron-dev/tesseron-typescript/tree/main/server), [`@tesseron/react`](https://github.com/tesseron-dev/tesseron-typescript/tree/main/react), [`@tesseron/svelte`](https://github.com/tesseron-dev/tesseron-typescript/tree/main/svelte), or [`@tesseron/vue`](https://github.com/tesseron-dev/tesseron-typescript/tree/main/vue) into your project, declare actions, and let the agent drive your real UI:

```ts
import { tesseron } from '@tesseron/web';
import { z } from 'zod';

tesseron.app({ id: 'todo_app', name: 'Todo App' });

tesseron
  .action('addTodo')
  .input(z.object({ text: z.string().min(1) }))
  .handler(({ text }) => {
    state.todos.push({ id: newId(), text, done: false });
    render();
    return { ok: true };
  });

await tesseron.connect();
```

See [`TypeScript examples/`](https://github.com/tesseron-dev/tesseron-typescript/tree/main/examples) for working apps in vanilla TS, React, Svelte, Vue, Express, and plain Node.

The Claude Code / Codex plugin lives at [`plugin/`](./plugin), exposed via the marketplace manifests at [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](./.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) (Claude) and [`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`](./.agents/plugins/marketplace.json) (Codex).

## Client capability support

Tesseron's action context gives handlers four capabilities beyond plain tool invocation, each backed by an MCP primitive. Whether a given call actually fires depends on what the user's MCP client advertises:

| SDK surface | MCP primitive |
|---|---|
| `tool(...)` (action invocation) | `tools` |
| `resource(...)` (live reads, subscriptions) | `resources` (+ `resources.subscribe`) |
| `ctx.sample(...)` | `sampling` |
| `ctx.confirm(...)` / `ctx.elicit(...)` | `elicitation` |
| `ctx.progress(...)` | `notifications/progress` (client must pass `_meta.progressToken` on `tools/call`) |

For the authoritative, continuously-updated list of which client supports which primitive, see the **[official MCP client compatibility matrix](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients)** — filter by `Sampling` or `Elicitation` to see how narrow the field still is. A few points worth knowing before you pick a capability:

- **Tools** are universal — every MCP client can invoke your actions.
- **Sampling** is the rarest. Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and Claude.ai do **not** expose it; today's support is concentrated in VS Code + GitHub Copilot, [goose](https://block.github.io/goose/), and [fast-agent](https://github.com/evalstate/fast-agent).
- **Elicitation** (MCP 2025-06) landed in Claude Code (2.1.76, March 2026), Cursor, Codex, VS Code Copilot, goose, and fast-agent, but **not** Claude Desktop, Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Windsurf, or Zed.
- When a capability is missing, Tesseron raises a typed error (`SamplingNotAvailableError`, `ElicitationNotAvailableError`) or collapses to the safe default (`ctx.confirm` returns `false`), so handlers can branch explicitly rather than silently misbehaving.

## Status

**v1.0** shipped April 2026; the SDK is at **v2.10** as of writing. The protocol is at [**1.2.0**](./docs/src/content/docs/protocol) and intentionally kept small: bidirectional JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket, dynamic MCP tool registration, click-to-connect handshake, streaming progress, cancellation, sampling, confirmation, schema-validated elicitation, subscribable resources, session resume.

The seven TypeScript SDK packages, `@tesseron/{core,web,server,react,svelte,vue,vite}`, share one version and should be installed together. The hub packages `@tesseron/mcp`, `@tesseron/docs-mcp`, and `@tesseron/conformance` release independently. See the [compatibility contract](https://tesseron-dev.github.io/tesseron/protocol/compatibility/) for cross-language rules.

The JS/TS SDKs are the reference implementation; the protocol spec is [CC BY 4.0](./docs/src/content/docs/protocol/LICENSE) so anyone can write a compatible client or server in any language. The [conformance fixtures](./conformance) are the executable half of that.

### Language SDK repositories

| Language | Source | Install |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | [tesseron-typescript](https://github.com/tesseron-dev/tesseron-typescript) | npm scope `@tesseron`: `core`, `web`, `server`, `react`, `svelte`, `vue`, `vite` |
| Rust | [tesseron-rust](https://github.com/tesseron-dev/tesseron-rust) | crate `tesseron`: `cargo add tesseron` |
| Python | [tesseron-python](https://github.com/tesseron-dev/tesseron-python) | PyPI `tesseron`: `uv add tesseron` |
| C++ | [tesseron-cpp](https://github.com/tesseron-dev/tesseron-cpp) | CMake `FetchContent` from that repo, link `tesseron::tesseron` |

All four speak protocol 1.2.0 and pass the shared conformance suite apart from fixtures their transports or claim flow do not support. SDK code and examples live in the language repositories; docs, protocol fixtures, and issues stay here.

On the roadmap: a Streamable HTTP transport and more desktop-native integrations. The Rust SDK already includes a Tauri example.
