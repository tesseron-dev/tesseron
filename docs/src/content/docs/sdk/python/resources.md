A resource is named application state the agent can read, and optionally follow. Actions change things; resources report them.

## Registering one

```python
from tesseron import JsonValue, TesseronApp

app = TesseronApp(id="python_todo", name="Python Todo")


async def read_todos() -> JsonValue:
    return [todo_payload(todo) for todo in store.todos]


todos_resource = app.resource(
    "todos://all",
    description="The complete todo list. Pushed on every mutation.",
    read=read_todos,
    subscribable=True,
)
```

This is the resource from the canonical [`examples/todo/app.py`](https://github.com/tesseron-dev/tesseron-python/blob/main/examples/todo/app.py).

`app.resource` answers with the `Resource` handle, which is what you push updates through. The reader is `async` and runs on every `resources/read`, so it always reports the current value rather than a snapshot taken at registration.

Registering one name twice raises `DuplicateNameError`.

## Registering after listen

`await app.listen()` returns a `TesseronHost`. Its `resource` method has the same arguments as `app.resource` and can register a resource after the host starts:

```python
host = await app.listen()

host.resource(
    "todos://all",
    description="The complete todo list.",
    read=read_todos,
    subscribable=True,
)
```

Host registration upserts by name. Registering an existing name replaces its descriptor, reader, and subscription handler while keeping its position in the manifest. `host.remove_resource(name)` returns `True` when a resource was removed and `False` when the name was unknown. Replacing or removing a resource stops its live subscriptions, and the agent resubscribes as needed. The app-level method still raises `DuplicateNameError` for a duplicate.

After the gateway welcomes the session, each registry change sends `resources/list_changed` with `{ "resources": [...] }`. Changes before welcome, or with no gateway connected, are silent; the next hello or resume carries the updated manifest. Each change sends one notification, with no coalescing.

These calls are synchronous and must run on the event loop thread, like the rest of the SDK.

## Pushing updates

```python
await todos_resource.publish(await read_todos())
```

`publish` goes to every agent currently subscribed to that resource, and does nothing when nobody is. Call it from wherever the state actually changes.

## Subscribing with your own source

Some state has a natural event source: a file watcher, a database listener, a queue. Hand `subscribe` a callback that starts it and answers with the cleanup that stops again:

```python
from tesseron import Emit, JsonValue, TesseronApp, Unsubscribe

app = TesseronApp(id="python_prompts", name="Python Prompts")


async def read_library() -> JsonValue:
    return [prompt_payload(prompt) for prompt in store.library()]


def follow(emit: Emit) -> Unsubscribe:
    watcher = start_watching(lambda value: emit(value))
    return watcher.stop


library_resource = app.resource(
    "library",
    description="Live snapshot of every prompt in the library. Pushed on every change.",
    read=read_library,
    subscribable=True,
    subscribe=follow,
)
```

`follow` is the application-specific addition to the canonical prompts app when a separate event source owns the updates.

The callback is synchronous and runs inside the session's read loop, so start your work and return promptly rather than awaiting in it. The cleanup runs when the agent unsubscribes, and again when the connection drops: a subscriber still holding a listener would emit into a closed socket for as long as the application runs.

Passing `subscribe` implies `subscribable=True`. A resource is also subscribable on `subscribable=True` alone, because `publish` is enough on its own to push updates.

## What the wire does

`resources/subscribe` and `resources/unsubscribe` both acknowledge with `result: null`. The acknowledgement goes out **before** the subscriber runs, so a value the subscriber emits immediately cannot overtake the response the agent is still waiting on.

Unsubscribing an id nobody registered is not an error. The agent and the transport can race, and there is nothing left to tear down either way.

Reading a resource that was never declared answers `-32003` with `Resource not readable: <name>`. Subscribing to one that was never declared, or to one that is not subscribable, answers `-32003` with `Resource not subscribable: <name>`. That is the same answer `@tesseron/core` gives.

A reader that raises `ActionError` sends that failure to the agent. A reader that raises anything else answers a bare `-32603`, with the cause kept on your side.
