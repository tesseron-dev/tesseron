`tesseron` is the Python host SDK. Your application listens on loopback, the MCP gateway dials in, and the agent gets typed actions and readable resources.

It speaks protocol [**1.2.0**](/protocol/), the same version the TypeScript, Rust, and C++ SDKs speak. Compatibility is decided by protocol version, never by matching package numbers: see the [compatibility contract](/protocol/compatibility/).

The host follows the protocol's envelope rules. A request with `id: null` is still a request and gets an answer with `id: null`; only an absent `id` makes a notification. A frame without `jsonrpc: "2.0"` gets `-32600 Invalid Request`, with its readable request id carried through or `null` when there is no usable id.

The package is published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tesseron/) and versions independently of the TypeScript SDK. Install it with `uv add tesseron`. Source and examples live in the `tesseron-python` repository.

## Requirements

Python 3.11 or newer. Two runtime dependencies: Pydantic v2 and `websockets`. Everything else is stdlib asyncio.

## A first host

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import asyncio

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from tesseron import ActionContext, JsonObject, JsonValue, TesseronApp


class AddTodoInput(BaseModel):
    text: str = Field(min_length=1)
    tag: str | None = None


def create_app() -> TesseronApp:
    app = TesseronApp(id="python_todo", name="Python Todo")
    store = TodoStore()

    async def read_todos() -> JsonValue:
        return [todo_payload(todo) for todo in store.todos]

    todos_resource = app.resource(
        "todos://all",
        description="The complete todo list. Pushed on every mutation.",
        read=read_todos,
        subscribable=True,
    )

    async def publish_todos() -> None:
        await todos_resource.publish(await read_todos())

    @app.action("addTodo", description="Add one todo")
    async def add_todo(input_data: AddTodoInput, context: ActionContext) -> JsonObject:
        del context
        todo = store.create(input_data.text, input_data.tag)
        await publish_todos()
        return todo_payload(todo)

    return app


async def main() -> None:
    app = create_app()
    host = await app.listen()
    try:
        await asyncio.Event().wait()
    finally:
        await host.shutdown()
```

The `TodoStore` and `todo_payload` definitions in this excerpt are the ones in [`examples/todo/app.py`](https://github.com/tesseron-dev/tesseron-python/blob/main/examples/todo/app.py). The complete example also registers the other canonical actions.

`app.listen()` binds `127.0.0.1` on a port the OS picks, writes the instance manifest the gateway watches for, and answers with a `TesseronHost` carrying the URL and the manifest path. Nothing dials out. The `app.action` and `app.resource` registrations in this example are made before `listen()`; the returned host can register, replace, and remove actions and resources at runtime.

The application id has to match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$` and cannot be `tesseron`, `mcp`, or `system`: the gateway uses it as an MCP tool prefix. An id that fails either rule raises `InvalidApplicationIdError` from `listen()` rather than binding a socket nobody can use.

## What it covers

Handshake and claiming, session resume with in-memory token rotation, action invocation with input validation, cancellation, per-action timeouts, streaming progress, sampling, confirmation, schema-checked elicitation, structured logs, and resources with reads, subscriptions, and pushes. All four capability flags are declared true.

Gateway-minted claims only, and WebSocket only. There is no Unix domain socket transport and no host-minted bind in this release, so the [conformance suite](/sdk/python/conformance/) skips those fixtures rather than pretending.

## The manifest

`listen()` publishes a v2 instance manifest into `~/.tesseron/instances/` once the URL is known: `0700` on the directory, `0600` on the file, removed again on `shutdown()`. POSIX modes are advisory on Windows, where the user account is the gate.

Point it somewhere else, or switch it off, with `ManifestPublication`:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from tesseron import ManifestPublication, TesseronApp

TesseronApp(id="python_todo", name="Python Todo", manifest=ManifestPublication.in_directory(Path("/tmp/x")))
TesseronApp(id="python_todo", name="Python Todo", manifest=ManifestPublication.disabled())
```

Disabling it is what a test harness wants. The conformance host does exactly that, because the runner dials an endpoint it was told about and should never touch a developer's `~/.tesseron`.

## Session events

`app.add_event_listener(listener)` takes a plain callable and gets `WelcomeEvent`, `ClaimedEvent`, `HandshakeFailedEvent`, and `DisconnectedEvent`. A listener that raises is logged and skipped: one bad listener must not break the session it was told about.

```python
from tesseron import ClaimedEvent, HostEvent


def watch(event: HostEvent) -> None:
    if isinstance(event, ClaimedEvent):
        print("claimed by", event.claimed.agent.name)


app.add_event_listener(watch)
```

## Development

Run these checks from the `tesseron-python` repository root:

```bash
uv sync --locked
uv run --locked ruff check .
uv run --locked ruff format --check .
uv run --locked mypy --strict src tests
uv run --locked pytest
uv build
```

Run the [conformance check](/sdk/python/conformance/) after the unit suite.
