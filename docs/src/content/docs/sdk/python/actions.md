An action is a named, typed, handler-backed operation the agent can invoke. The gateway projects each one into an MCP tool.

## The decorator

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from tesseron import ActionContext, JsonObject, TesseronApp


class AddTodoInput(BaseModel):
    text: str = Field(min_length=1)
    tag: str | None = None


def create_app() -> TesseronApp:
    app = TesseronApp(id="python_todo", name="Python Todo")

    @app.action("addTodo", description="Add one todo")
    async def add_todo(input_data: AddTodoInput, context: ActionContext) -> JsonObject:
        del context
        todo = store.create(input_data.text, input_data.tag)
        await publish_todos()
        return todo_payload(todo)

    return app
```

The `store`, `publish_todos`, and `todo_payload` names above come directly from the canonical [`examples/todo/app.py`](https://github.com/tesseron-dev/tesseron-python/blob/main/examples/todo/app.py) host.

Every handler is `async def` and takes `(input_data, context)`. A handler that is not a coroutine function, or that does not take two parameters, raises `HostError` at registration. Registering one name twice raises `DuplicateNameError`, because the manifest has to stay unambiguous for the gateway to project it.

## Input comes from the annotation

If the first parameter is annotated with a Pydantic `BaseModel`, that model is the input contract. Two things follow from it:

1. The manifest publishes `model_json_schema(mode="validation")`, unchanged. Validation mode is the right one here: the agent is producing input, not reading output, so aliases and defaults have to be described the way the model will accept them.
2. Dispatch runs `model_validate` before the handler body. Input that does not fit is refused with [`-32004 InputValidation`](/protocol/errors/), and the handler never runs.

The refusal carries every problem Pydantic found, not just the first:

```json
{
  "code": -32004,
  "message": "Invalid input",
  "data": [
    { "message": "String should have at least 1 character", "path": ["text"] },
    { "message": "Input should be a valid string", "path": ["tag"] }
  ]
}
```

## Raw JSON input

Annotate the first parameter with anything else and the handler takes the invocation input as raw JSON. Then `input_schema` is what the manifest publishes and `validate` is what enforces it:

```python
from tesseron import ActionContext, JsonValue, ValidationIssue


def positive_amount(raw_input: JsonValue) -> list[ValidationIssue]:
    if isinstance(raw_input, dict) and isinstance(raw_input.get("amount"), int | float):
        return []
    return [ValidationIssue(message="amount must be a number", path=["amount"])]


@app.action(
    "charge",
    description="Charge the saved card",
    input_schema={"type": "object", "properties": {"amount": {"type": "number"}}},
    validate=positive_amount,
)
async def charge(raw_input: JsonValue, context: ActionContext) -> JsonValue:
    return {"charged": True}
```

A non-empty issue list becomes the same `-32004` failure, with the same `data` shape. Leave `validate` off and nothing is checked: the schema is then documentation for the agent and nothing more.

## The other options

| Argument | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `description` | Published in the manifest. The gateway uses it as the MCP tool description, so write it for the agent. |
| `input_schema` | Overrides the schema derived from the model, or supplies one for a raw handler. |
| `output_schema` | Published when set. Nothing validates output against it; it tells the agent what to expect. |
| `timeout_ms` | Per-action deadline. Past it the invocation answers [`-32002 Timeout`](/protocol/errors/) and the handler task is cancelled. The default is 60 seconds. |
| `validate` | Extra input check for a raw handler. Ignored when the input type comes from a model. |

## Registering after listen

`await app.listen()` returns a `TesseronHost`. Its `action` decorator has the same arguments as `app.action` and can register an action after the host starts:

```python
host = await app.listen()


@host.action("refresh", description="Refresh cached data")
async def refresh(raw_input: JsonObject, context: ActionContext) -> JsonObject:
    del raw_input, context
    return {"ok": True}
```

Host registration upserts by name. Registering an existing name replaces its descriptor and handler while keeping its position in the manifest. `host.remove_action(name)` returns `True` when an action was removed and `False` when the name was unknown. The app-level decorator still raises `DuplicateNameError` for a duplicate.

After the gateway welcomes the session, each registry change sends `actions/list_changed` with `{ "actions": [full manifest] }`. Changes before welcome, or with no gateway connected, are silent; the next hello or resume carries the updated manifest. Each change sends one notification, with no coalescing.

These calls are synchronous and must run on the event loop thread, like the rest of the SDK.

## What a handler may return

Output is converted to JSON before it leaves. Pydantic models go through `model_dump(mode="json")`, enums through their value, mappings and sequences recursively, and `None`, `bool`, `int`, `float`, `str` as they are.

Anything else has no defined wire shape, so it fails as an internal error rather than reaching the agent as the string of a repr. Return a model or a dict.

## Failing on purpose

Raise `ActionError` when the handler cannot produce its output:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from tesseron import ActionContext, ActionError, JsonObject


class TodoIdentifierInput(BaseModel):
    id: str


@app.action("deleteTodo", description="Delete one todo")
async def delete_todo(input_data: TodoIdentifierInput, context: ActionContext) -> JsonObject:
    del context
    original_length = len(store.todos)
    store.todos[:] = [todo for todo in store.todos if todo.id != input_data.id]
    if len(store.todos) == original_length:
        raise ActionError.handler("Todo not found", {"kind": "not_found"})
    await publish_todos()
    return {"id": input_data.id, "removed": True}
```

This is the canonical `deleteTodo` shape from [`examples/todo/app.py`](https://github.com/tesseron-dev/tesseron-python/blob/main/examples/todo/app.py).

`ActionError.handler` sends its message and data to the agent as `-32005`. `ActionError.protocol(code, message, data)` does the same under a code you pick. `ActionError.internal(cause)` keeps the cause on your side and answers with a bare `-32603 Internal error`, which is what an unhandled exception in a handler is turned into too. See [errors](/sdk/python/errors/).
