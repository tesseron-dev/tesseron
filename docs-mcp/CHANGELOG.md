### Patch Changes

- [`12093df`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/tesseron/commit/12093df7da78f3d095dde3036a599cc29ee59ac2) by @Eigenwise - Docs: the `@tesseron/mcp` pin on the gateway page now follows releases through `sync-plugin-version`, and the C++ installation page fetches the `v0.1.0` tag instead of `main`.

- [`ecd2c3b`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/tesseron/commit/ecd2c3b764f442e045a264f2bc11b8ccac25c4ef) by @Eigenwise - Forward actions/list_changed and resources/list_changed from apps to the agent.

- [`45a9e1b`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/tesseron/commit/45a9e1b951a027afba1b57da66c6ea6b3ff37e60) by @Eigenwise - Point SDK source, installation, example, and conformance documentation at the four language repositories. Keep protocol docs and SDK issue reporting in the hub.

## 2.10.2

### Patch Changes

- [`675867a`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/tesseron/commit/675867a495d2e60be3b9624904eccb2673ff38f1) by @Eigenwise - Reject unusable handshake welcomes, answer malformed JSON-RPC envelopes, and document both wire behaviors.

- [`73c510d`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/tesseron/commit/73c510db0d0bad45c099d309e27b3f7349911990) by @Eigenwise - Document the C++ canonical todo and prompts examples and how to run their gateway e2e check.

- The C++ conformance page now reports the current corpus result (29 passed, 10
  skipped) after the C++ host started answering a frame without `jsonrpc: "2.0"`
  with a -32600 error instead of dropping it.

- [`bf38d9f`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/tesseron/commit/bf38d9f5bbf69961ca191bc09370832d2d1ab4f4) by @Eigenwise - Reconcile the C++ SDK docs with the shipped examples and add errors and threading pages.

- [`b9fc9be`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/tesseron/commit/b9fc9be4d3dcc16e7d25fa12346af22a78d4da78) by @Eigenwise - Add the C++ SDK to the docs snapshot: six pages under `sdk/cpp/` covering the
  build, actions, resources, the `ActionContext`, and conformance, plus a row on
  the compatibility page. The C++ host declares all four handshake capabilities
  and leaves out host-minted claim codes and unix domain sockets, which is what
  its 10 skipped conformance fixtures are.

- [`2202dfc`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/tesseron/commit/2202dfc2581a119440485475605c137df62ff25b) by @Eigenwise - Refresh the docs snapshot with the corrected 1.2 protocol spec: the published
  `protocolVersion` was `1.1.0` in eight places, `tesseron/bind` was undocumented,
  and both transport-binding pages still described the 1.1 handshake (including
  the `tesseron/hello` direction, which was backwards).

  This is the first release where `@tesseron/docs-mcp` moves on its own. It has
  left the changesets `fixed` group, so a prose correction no longer forces a
  version bump across all eight SDK packages.

- [`816b6ae`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/tesseron/commit/816b6ae5bd41414f18286da92c3fddcf95a44d46) by @Eigenwise - The vanilla-todo example page lists the `todos://all` resource the todo examples now expose.

- [`21af3d1`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/tesseron/commit/21af3d15340b377ad5eda3602f5cd115b1679139) by @Eigenwise - Clarify sampling-depth ownership and the 1.2.0 elicitation schema validation rules, including the validator's current lenient cases.

- [`43a546a`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/tesseron/commit/43a546a0da9878ce9cd2bfa49d16d2fe52ceb0d2) by @Eigenwise - Reconcile the Python SDK docs with the shipped examples, envelope rules, conformance results, and hub SDK links.

- [`7f936bd`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/tesseron/commit/7f936bdeabc03b94576f4f3174d9252be7642115) by @Eigenwise - Refresh the docs snapshot with the Python SDK pages. The `sdk/python` section was a
  placeholder describing a planned implementation with an API sketch that never shipped; it
  is now six pages covering the real one (overview, actions, resources, context, errors,
  conformance). The compatibility table gets a Python row, and the SDK index no longer calls
  it planned.

- [`95c94b0`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/tesseron/commit/95c94b0878c94f70aa3f5c2e54e416b0ffab0a7b) by @Eigenwise - Add the Rust SDK docs section, Tauri guide, and links from the SDK and porting pages.

### Minor Changes

- [`af19ac3`](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/commit/af19ac3a0013fccbd05d6dec5cc0c0eb6b7e057e) by Kenny - feat(vite, web, react, vue, svelte, mcp): session resume is now the default — no more claim-code dance on refresh

  A casual page refresh keeps the same Tesseron session paired with the agent.
  The work coordinates four layers; each is independently correct, and together
  they make refresh-without-re-claim work end-to-end for every host.
  - **@tesseron/vite** — replaces the per-WS instance model with a
    **SessionManager**. The unit of identity is now a `Session` keyed by
    `sessionId`, not the browser WebSocket. Browser WSes attach via `tesseron/hello`
    (create) or `tesseron/resume` (re-attach to an existing Session); browser
    detach starts an idle TTL (default 4 h, configurable via the new
    `sessionIdleTtlMs` option), and a reattaching browser within that window
    cancels it. The gateway-side bridge stays open across detach/reattach so
    the agent never sees a disconnect. The previous "host-mint sessions don't
    honour resume" rejection ([#68](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/68)) is replaced by proper resume validation:
    constant-time compare against the stored resume token, rotate on success,
    fall through to `ResumeFailed` on any miss.
  - **@tesseron/mcp** — bumps `DEFAULT_RESUME_TTL_MS` from 90 seconds to
    **4 hours** for the gateway-mint path (Node-side hosts via `@tesseron/server`).
    A `TESSERON_RESUME_TTL_MS` env var (non-negative integer milliseconds; `0`
    disables resume) lets operators tune it without a fork.
  - **@tesseron/web** — `tesseron.connect()` auto-persists the
    `{ sessionId, resumeToken }` pair to `localStorage` (`'tesseron:resume'`)
    and replays it on the next connect. New `WebConnectOptions.resume` accepts:
    `true`/omitted (default), `false`, a string key, a `ResumeStorage` backend,
    or an explicit `ResumeCredentials` literal.
  - **@tesseron/react** — `useTesseronConnection`'s `resume` default flips from
    off to `true`. The hook always passes an explicit `resume` to the web SDK
    so the SDK's own auto-persist layer doesn't double-write under the hook's
    storage.
  - **@tesseron/vue** and **@tesseron/svelte** — full parity with React:
    `resume` option (defaults to `true`), `resumeStatus` on the reactive state,
    `onWelcomeChange` subscription so `claimCode` clears automatically when an
    agent claims (previously stayed stale until refresh).

  Behavioural envelope:
  - Same session survives refresh, HMR reload, brief network blip, and even a
    short laptop sleep, for both browser tabs (`@tesseron/vite`) and Node
    processes (`@tesseron/server`).
  - Invalid resume tokens (TTL expired, gateway/host restarted, corrupted
    storage) fail gracefully: `ResumeFailed` → SDK clears storage → fresh
    `tesseron/hello` → new claim code.
  - Opt out everywhere with `{ resume: false }` for incognito-style flows.

  No protocol bump — the wire shape is unchanged. See the [session resume
  docs](https://tesseron.dev/protocol/resume/) and the
  [vite plugin's Session model](https://tesseron.dev/sdk/typescript/vite/#sessions-span-browser-refreshes)
  for the implementation details and the [security model](https://tesseron.dev/protocol/security/)
  for the threat-model notes (unchanged: same-UID local process can read
  `localStorage` and `~/.tesseron/instances/`, so the host-mint resume window
  is the same trust surface as the existing claim-code flow).

## 2.8.1

### Patch Changes

- [#89](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/pull/89) [`77f8a64`](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/commit/77f8a641c8fb514baefe7e4b24a605772711a2ae) by Kenny - fix(core, web, react): make `connect()` re-entrant so claimed-session resume survives StrictMode and HMR (closes [#88](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/88))

  Two `connect()` calls used to race on `this.transport`: the second closed the
  first's socket mid-handshake, frames in flight on either socket — including
  the gateway's `tesseron/resume` response — could be lost, and a claimed
  session ended up displaying a fresh claim code instead of resuming. The
  predecessor fix in [#68](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/68) papered this over for unclaimed sessions, but
  claimed-session resume across full page reloads (e.g. Vite hot-reloading a
  module-scope side effect) still failed.

  Now:
  - `TesseronClient.connect()` (core) eagerly closes the prior transport on
    re-entry, then queues the new handshake behind the prior connect's
    settlement and the prior transport's `onClose` drain. New dispatcher
    state is only installed once the old socket has stopped touching it,
    so a late-firing `onClose` can never trample the new welcome.
  - `WebTesseronClient.connect()` (web, URL form) deduplicates concurrent
    calls with the same URL and the same resume credentials: the second
    caller shares the in-flight promise (and the in-flight WebSocket)
    instead of opening a parallel one. Without de-dup, the gateway would
    receive two `tesseron/resume` requests carrying the same single-shot
    token, the first would consume the zombie, and the second would
    invariably fail with `ResumeFailed`.
  - `useTesseronConnection` (react) now defers transport ownership to the
    singleton's URL-form `connect()` and no longer closes the WebSocket on
    cleanup. Under React 18 StrictMode the second mount dedupes onto the
    first mount's still-in-flight promise, so only one socket is opened
    and only one `tesseron/resume` reaches the gateway.

  Consumer apps can now drop the `beforeunload`-clears-`tesseron:resume`
  workaround that was needed to mask the race; the SDK manages the
  lifecycle by itself.

### Minor Changes

- [#82](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/pull/82) [`cba7894`](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/commit/cba7894a3a90fb6b2de7f2a1955ca842a514100b) by Kenny - feat: add `@tesseron/pi` Pi coding-agent plugin

  New workspace package shipping a Pi extension (`@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`) that exposes the Tesseron MCP gateway and docs server as eight typed Pi tools (`tesseron_claim_session`, `tesseron_list_actions`, `tesseron_list_pending_claims`, `tesseron_invoke_action`, `tesseron_read_resource`, `tesseron_docs_list`, `tesseron_docs_search`, `tesseron_docs_read`) plus the same five-skill bundle the Claude/Codex plugin ships. Install with `pi install -l npm:@tesseron/pi@<v>`.

  The Pi extension uses a hand-rolled stdio JSON-RPC client (no `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` dep) to spawn `npx -y @tesseron/{mcp,docs-mcp}@<version>` as child processes and forward `tools/call` requests. Pinned `@tesseron/mcp` version stays in lockstep with the rest of the SDK fixed group via an extension to `scripts/sync-plugin-version.mjs`, which now also mirrors `plugin/skills/` → `packages/pi/skills/` and fails CI on any drift.
