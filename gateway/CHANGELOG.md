  Two families of copy-pasted code are collapsed to one source each. Every
  public API — React hooks, Svelte stores, Vue composables, the gateway, the
  server transports — is byte-for-byte behaviour-compatible; the duplication just
  moves out of sight.

  **Browser adapters.** `@tesseron/react`, `/svelte`, and `/vue` previously each
  carried their own copy of the connection state machine (connect → resume →
  `ResumeFailed` fallback → token rotation → save → `onWelcomeChange`), the
  action/resource builder-chain application, the `localStorage` resume backend,
  and the option/state types — with parity kept only by convention. That drift
  surface is gone. A new framework-neutral reactive core in `@tesseron/web`
  (`createConnectionController`, `registerAction`, `registerResource`,
  `resolveResumeStorage`, `localStorageResumeBackend`, and the shared
  `TesseronConnectionState` / `TesseronConnectionOptions` / `TesseronActionOptions`
  / `TesseronResourceOptions` / `TesseronResumeStatus` types) holds the logic
  once; each adapter is now a thin (~10-line-per-primitive) binding onto its
  framework's reactivity and lifecycle. The per-framework public names are
  unchanged (React keeps its `Use…Options` aliases; Svelte/Vue surface the shared
  types through their existing `export *`).

  **Node utilities.** The byte-identical `fs-hygiene.ts` (three copies across
  `/server`, `/vite`, `/mcp`), the duplicated claim/session/token mint helpers
  (`/server`, `/vite`, plus inline in `/mcp`), and the host-bind helpers — the
  rolling-window bind rate limiter, the `tesseron/hello` detector, the synthesized
  pre-claim welcome, and the bind-failure lockout constants (byte-identical across
  the two `/server` host transports and re-implemented again in `/vite`) — now
  live once behind the new node-only `@tesseron/core/node` subpath
  (`ensurePrivateDir`, `writePrivateFile`, `mintClaimCode`, `mintSessionId`,
  `mintInvocationId`, `mintResumeToken`, `BindRateLimiter`, `isHelloFrame`,
  `buildSynthesizedWelcomeResponse`, `BIND_FAILURE_*`). The main `@tesseron/core`
  entry stays browser-safe. The drift-detection parity test that guarded the three
  `fs-hygiene` copies is removed — there is nothing left to drift. `@tesseron/mcp`
  keeps its historical `generate*` names as re-export aliases.

### Patch Changes

- [`7b9236a`](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/commit/7b9236a9c4dd2f6a0d493d8b9e96c59a58be96a8) by Kenny - fix(mcp, core): route around dead-transport sessions in the bridge selector (closes [#92](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/92))

  When two sessions for the same `app.id` co-existed in the gateway's claimed
  map, `latestClaimedByApp` picked whichever had the most recent `claimedAt`
  without checking that the underlying transport was still alive. If the
  newer session's `onClose` handler hadn't fired yet (long-tailed WebSocket
  close event, fast double-claim, OS-level FIN delay), every subsequent
  `tools/call` from the agent forwarded `actions/invoke` to a closed socket
  and the MCP tool call hung until the upstream client's own timeout.

  The fix adds an optional liveness probe to the protocol-level Transport
  interface (`Transport.isClosed?(): boolean`) and implements it on both the
  gateway's WS and UDS dialer transports. The bridge selector
  (`mcp-bridge.ts#latestClaimedByApp`) now skips any session whose transport
  reports closed, so the live session wins regardless of `claimedAt` order.
  When every candidate for an `app.id` is dead, the call fails fast with
  the existing "no claimed session" error instead of hanging.

  Backward compatible — `isClosed` is optional; transports that don't
  implement it are treated as live (preserves pre-[#92](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/92) behaviour for those
  transports).

  The Tesseron 2.9.0 host-mint resume flow already avoids the race for vite
  hosts (the SessionManager keeps the gateway WS alive across browser
  refreshes), but the gateway selector is now defence-in-depth for any
  multi-claim scenario: a parallel Claude Code instance also paired, a fast
  HMR cycle, or a non-vite host that doesn't hide the disconnect.

### Minor Changes

- [`af19ac3`](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/commit/af19ac3a0013fccbd05d6dec5cc0c0eb6b7e057e) by Kenny - feat(vite, web, react, vue, svelte, mcp): session resume is now the default — no more claim-code dance on refresh

  A casual page refresh keeps the same Tesseron session paired with the agent.
  The work coordinates four layers; each is independently correct, and together
  they make refresh-without-re-claim work end-to-end for every host.
  - **@tesseron/vite** — replaces the per-WS instance model with a
    **SessionManager**. The unit of identity is now a `Session` keyed by
    `sessionId`, not the browser WebSocket. Browser WSes attach via `tesseron/hello`
    (create) or `tesseron/resume` (re-attach to an existing Session); browser
    detach starts an idle TTL (default 4 h, configurable via the new
    `sessionIdleTtlMs` option), and a reattaching browser within that window
    cancels it. The gateway-side bridge stays open across detach/reattach so
    the agent never sees a disconnect. The previous "host-mint sessions don't
    honour resume" rejection ([#68](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/68)) is replaced by proper resume validation:
    constant-time compare against the stored resume token, rotate on success,
    fall through to `ResumeFailed` on any miss.
  - **@tesseron/mcp** — bumps `DEFAULT_RESUME_TTL_MS` from 90 seconds to
    **4 hours** for the gateway-mint path (Node-side hosts via `@tesseron/server`).
    A `TESSERON_RESUME_TTL_MS` env var (non-negative integer milliseconds; `0`
    disables resume) lets operators tune it without a fork.
  - **@tesseron/web** — `tesseron.connect()` auto-persists the
    `{ sessionId, resumeToken }` pair to `localStorage` (`'tesseron:resume'`)
    and replays it on the next connect. New `WebConnectOptions.resume` accepts:
    `true`/omitted (default), `false`, a string key, a `ResumeStorage` backend,
    or an explicit `ResumeCredentials` literal.
  - **@tesseron/react** — `useTesseronConnection`'s `resume` default flips from
    off to `true`. The hook always passes an explicit `resume` to the web SDK
    so the SDK's own auto-persist layer doesn't double-write under the hook's
    storage.
  - **@tesseron/vue** and **@tesseron/svelte** — full parity with React:
    `resume` option (defaults to `true`), `resumeStatus` on the reactive state,
    `onWelcomeChange` subscription so `claimCode` clears automatically when an
    agent claims (previously stayed stale until refresh).

  Behavioural envelope:
  - Same session survives refresh, HMR reload, brief network blip, and even a
    short laptop sleep, for both browser tabs (`@tesseron/vite`) and Node
    processes (`@tesseron/server`).
  - Invalid resume tokens (TTL expired, gateway/host restarted, corrupted
    storage) fail gracefully: `ResumeFailed` → SDK clears storage → fresh
    `tesseron/hello` → new claim code.
  - Opt out everywhere with `{ resume: false }` for incognito-style flows.

  No protocol bump — the wire shape is unchanged. See the [session resume
  docs](https://tesseron.dev/protocol/resume/) and the
  [vite plugin's Session model](https://tesseron.dev/sdk/typescript/vite/#sessions-span-browser-refreshes)
  for the implementation details and the [security model](https://tesseron.dev/protocol/security/)
  for the threat-model notes (unchanged: same-UID local process can read
  `localStorage` and `~/.tesseron/instances/`, so the host-mint resume window
  is the same trust surface as the existing claim-code flow).

### Patch Changes

- [#89](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/pull/89) [`77f8a64`](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/commit/77f8a641c8fb514baefe7e4b24a605772711a2ae) by Kenny - fix(core, web, react): make `connect()` re-entrant so claimed-session resume survives StrictMode and HMR (closes [#88](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/88))

  Two `connect()` calls used to race on `this.transport`: the second closed the
  first's socket mid-handshake, frames in flight on either socket — including
  the gateway's `tesseron/resume` response — could be lost, and a claimed
  session ended up displaying a fresh claim code instead of resuming. The
  predecessor fix in [#68](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/68) papered this over for unclaimed sessions, but
  claimed-session resume across full page reloads (e.g. Vite hot-reloading a
  module-scope side effect) still failed.

  Now:
  - `TesseronClient.connect()` (core) eagerly closes the prior transport on
    re-entry, then queues the new handshake behind the prior connect's
    settlement and the prior transport's `onClose` drain. New dispatcher
    state is only installed once the old socket has stopped touching it,
    so a late-firing `onClose` can never trample the new welcome.
  - `WebTesseronClient.connect()` (web, URL form) deduplicates concurrent
    calls with the same URL and the same resume credentials: the second
    caller shares the in-flight promise (and the in-flight WebSocket)
    instead of opening a parallel one. Without de-dup, the gateway would
    receive two `tesseron/resume` requests carrying the same single-shot
    token, the first would consume the zombie, and the second would
    invariably fail with `ResumeFailed`.
  - `useTesseronConnection` (react) now defers transport ownership to the
    singleton's URL-form `connect()` and no longer closes the WebSocket on
    cleanup. Under React 18 StrictMode the second mount dedupes onto the
    first mount's still-in-flight promise, so only one socket is opened
    and only one `tesseron/resume` reaches the gateway.

  Consumer apps can now drop the `beforeunload`-clears-`tesseron:resume`
  workaround that was needed to mask the race; the SDK manages the
  lifecycle by itself.

  New workspace package shipping a Pi extension (`@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`) that exposes the Tesseron MCP gateway and docs server as eight typed Pi tools (`tesseron_claim_session`, `tesseron_list_actions`, `tesseron_list_pending_claims`, `tesseron_invoke_action`, `tesseron_read_resource`, `tesseron_docs_list`, `tesseron_docs_search`, `tesseron_docs_read`) plus the same five-skill bundle the Claude/Codex plugin ships. Install with `pi install -l npm:@tesseron/pi@<v>`.

  The Pi extension uses a hand-rolled stdio JSON-RPC client (no `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` dep) to spawn `npx -y @tesseron/{mcp,docs-mcp}@<version>` as child processes and forward `tools/call` requests. Pinned `@tesseron/mcp` version stays in lockstep with the rest of the SDK fixed group via an extension to `scripts/sync-plugin-version.mjs`, which now also mirrors `plugin/skills/` → `packages/pi/skills/` and fails CI on any drift.

The Claude Code plugin no longer ships a pre-bundled gateway under `plugin/server/`; instead `plugin/.mcp.json` invokes `@tesseron/mcp` and `@tesseron/docs-mcp` via `npx -y <pkg>@<version>` with the version pinned to the plugin's own. This adds a one-time cold-start cost on first launch but matches the canonical distribution form every other major MCP server uses (filesystem, sequential-thinking, Playwright, Chrome DevTools, Sentry, Supabase) and unblocks the same plugin for Codex (`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` + `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` fallback) and OpenCode (`opencode.json` snippet documented in the plugin README).

  The two former subagents (`tesseron-explorer`, `tesseron-reviewer`) are now skills under `plugin/skills/`, since SKILL.md is the only customization primitive that auto-triggers identically across Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode. Subagent runtime semantics differ across clients; skills do not.

  `AGENTS.md` is added at the repo root for cross-client agent instructions; `CLAUDE.md` reduces to a single `@AGENTS.md` include.

  No published-package source changed. The lockstep group bumps so the version pin in `plugin/.mcp.json` resolves to a real npm release.

  When a browser session is replaced by a fresh-hello (after an `@tesseron/react` resume race per [#68](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/68), a manual reload, or any other condition that invalidates the prior session), agent-side MCP tools that hold a cached claim previously got a flat `No claimed session found for app "<id>".` error with no actionable recovery path. The agent's reflex of retrying `tesseron__claim_session` with the previously-known code also failed, leaving the user to read the new claim code from the app UI and paste it back manually.

  **`tesseron__list_pending_claims` (new meta tool).** Lists every claim code the gateway can currently redeem — gateway-minted sessions waiting in `pendingClaims`, plus host-minted manifests under `~/.tesseron/instances/` whose `boundAgent` is `null` and whose `expiresAt` (when present) hasn't elapsed. Each entry carries the code, app id, app name, source mint flow, and unix timestamps. The agent calls this on the failure path, picks the entry whose `app_id` matches its cached app, and re-pairs without a user round-trip. Surfaced in the default `both` and `meta` tool surfaces; suppressed in `dynamic`.

  **Improved error messages.** `tesseron__invoke_action` and `tesseron__read_resource` now name the recovery tool by name in the "No claimed session found" body, and inline the matching pending claim code(s) when one exists for the same app id. `tesseron__claim_session` similarly mentions other pending codes when the user typed a code the gateway doesn't have, so a typo doesn't dead-end.

  **Internal.** `Session` and `ZombieSession` carry a new `mintedAt: number` field set at session creation and preserved across resume so `getPendingClaims()` reports a stable timestamp for sorting. `TesseronGateway.getPendingClaims()` is the new public method the bridge consumes; it returns `PendingClaim[]` (also exported for embedders).

  Tests cover the new meta tool's empty + populated states, expired host-minted entry filtering, and the wrong-code claim path with a pending manifest discovered via `watchInstances`.

- [#66](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/pull/66) [`f93b7f6`](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/commit/f93b7f6a3f607a9d6a36f309b64379ce4fb82d0c) Thanks [@KennyVaneetvelde](https://github.com/KennyVaneetvelde)! - Complete the tesseron#60 claim-mediated transport binding by extending the host-mint flow to every host shape and tightening the security model:

  **`@tesseron/server` host-mint mirror.** `NodeWebSocketServerTransport` and `UnixSocketServerTransport` now mint `claimCode` / `sessionId` / `resumeToken` at construction, write them into the manifest's `hostMintedClaim`, and intercept the SDK's `tesseron/hello` to synthesize the welcome locally so the SDK can show the host-minted code as soon as `connect()` resolves — no waiting for a gateway dial.

  **UDS bind handshake.** UDS doesn't have WebSocket subprotocols, so the equivalent of `tesseron-bind.<code>` is the new `tesseron/bind` JSON-RPC request. A v1.2 gateway sends it as the very first NDJSON frame after connect; the host validates the code in constant time and either accepts (bind succeeds, hello replay flows) or returns `Unauthorized` and closes. Same two-gate model as WS: file-mode-based UID enforcement on the socket inode + bind validation.

  **Sliding TTL with heartbeat.** Every host-minted claim now carries `expiresAt = mintedAt + 10 minutes`. The host rewrites the manifest every 5 minutes while the SDK is alive and the claim is unbound; the gateway skips manifests whose `expiresAt < now` during scan. A tab forgotten overnight expires its code before someone else can paste it; a live tab's code stays valid forever.

  **Bind failure rate-limit.** Hosts track bind-mismatch failures in a 60-second rolling window. After 5 mismatches, the entry is locked out for 60 seconds — every bind upgrade gets HTTP 429 (WS) or `Unauthorized` (UDS) — long enough to make sustained brute force expensive without breaking a legitimate retry loop. Counters reset on a successful bind.

  **Legacy auto-dial rejected.** Host transports now require a v1.2-aware gateway. Legacy auto-dials (no bind subprotocol on WS, no `tesseron/bind` on UDS) are rejected with HTTP 426 Upgrade Required and a clear message: upgrade `@tesseron/mcp` to >= 2.4.0. The plugin bundle ships in `plugin/server/index.cjs`, so a Claude Code plugin update brings the user along automatically.

  **Workspace package layout.** `@tesseron/{core,web,server,react,vite,svelte,vue,mcp}` packages now point `main` / `module` at `dist/` (built output) instead of `src/index.ts` directly. Without this change, Node ESM's `.js` ↔ `.ts` resolution fails when a Vite plugin loads the workspace package as a transitive dep — fixes the Vite dev-server demo's previously-broken plugin-load. The `types` field still points at `src/index.ts` so editor go-to-definition keeps working.

  **Validation parity.** `validateAppId` moved to `@tesseron/core/internal` so the host transports re-apply the same rejection logic the gateway has on its hello handler. The SDK's `connect()` now rejects with `"Invalid app id"` / `"... is reserved"` at hello synthesis time rather than after a successful welcome that the gateway would have refused.

  **`tesseron/claimed.agentCapabilities`.** The notification carries the gateway's authoritative sampling/elicitation bits so the SDK can overwrite the host's conservative pre-claim defaults. Action handlers gating on `ctx.agentCapabilities.sampling` see real values rather than the synthesized `false`s.

  **Tests:** new `gateway/test/server-host-mint.test.ts` exercises the full ServerTesseronClient ↔ gateway round-trip with a real bind. Existing tests updated to use `dialSdk`'s v3 path. Three legacy-only breadcrumb tests skipped pending a hand-rolled legacy SDK fixture; the breadcrumb code stays in the gateway for v1.1 SDK back-compat.

  **End-to-end validation:** ran the `sdks/typescript/examples/vanilla-todo` demo in a real browser, scraped the host-minted claim code, drove an MCP gateway (in-process) to `tesseron__claim_session(code)`. The gateway dialed with the bind subprotocol, the v3 hello replay flowed, the session was registered as claimed with the host-minted ids, the MCP tool list refreshed to show all 9 vanilla_todo actions, and an MCP-invoked `addTodo` round-tripped back to the browser DOM. All 6 demo apps (vanilla-todo, react-todo, svelte-todo, vue-todo, node-prompts, express-prompts) typecheck and build clean.

The MCP gateway no longer races other gateways to dial a freshly-opened browser tab and mint the user-pasteable claim code in whichever it wins. Instead the SDK host (Vite plugin / `@tesseron/server`) mints the code itself and writes it into the instance manifest; the gateway only dials when the user's `tesseron__claim_session(code)` call matches a host-minted manifest, and authenticates the dial via a `tesseron-bind.<code>` WebSocket subprotocol element.

  **Why.** With one Claude Code session per gateway process, several gateways often watch `~/.tesseron/instances/` simultaneously. The first to dial a new manifest won the bridge, but on multi-session boxes the OS scheduler picked which gateway saw the welcome — and the user-typed code was usable only in that one Claude window. The single-owner-binding fix from [#54](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/54) made the race deterministic; this PR makes it irrelevant. The user pastes the code into whichever Claude session they're working in; that gateway scans manifests for a match and dials only the right one. No race, no "switch to the Claude that minted this" detour.

  **Wire shape.**
  - `InstanceManifest` (still `version: 2`) gains two optional fields: `helloHandledByHost: true` and `hostMintedClaim: { code, sessionId, mintedAt, boundAgent }`. v1.1 gateways ignore the new fields and still auto-dial — no regression for old gateways paired with new hosts.
  - New WebSocket subprotocol element `tesseron-bind.<code>` carries the host-minted claim code on the gateway's outbound dial, alongside the existing `tesseron-gateway` element. Subprotocol headers don't appear in URL logs, browser history, or crash dumps the way `?claim=CODE` query strings would.
  - Constant-time compare (PR [#62](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/62)'s `constantTimeEqual`) gates the bind validation in the host's upgrade handler.
  - The gateway's welcome to a v3-mode dial omits `claimCode` — the host's synthesized welcome already showed it; repeating would race the SDK's UI.

  **`gateway.claimSession()` is now async.** Returns `Promise<Session | null>` rather than `Session | null`. The legacy `pendingClaims` lookup happens first (synchronous in practice), then the host-minted scan dials and waits for the session to register. The `@tesseron/mcp` bridge is the only public caller; embedders calling the method directly need to add `await`.

  **Migration matrix.**
  - old plugin / old gateway → unchanged
  - new plugin / old gateway → old gateway ignores host-mint fields, auto-dials, mints its own code, host's hello goes through unmodified
  - old plugin / new gateway → no host-mint fields in manifest, gateway auto-dials as legacy
  - new plugin / new gateway → host mints, gateway scans on claim, dials with bind subprotocol, session is born claimed

  **Out of scope (follow-up issues).**
  - TTL refresh on heartbeat (the host's mint lives until manifest unlink today; a stale code can be claimed if the browser tab outlives the user's intent).
  - Rate-limit on bind failures (the constant-time grammar guard plus the 6-char alphabet make brute force expensive but unbounded).
  - `@tesseron/server` host-mint mirror — server transports still use the legacy auto-dial path. Tracked separately.
  - UDS bind subprotocol equivalent. Tracked separately.

  New `@tesseron/core` exports under `/internal`: `formatBindSubprotocol`, `parseBindSubprotocol`, `BIND_SUBPROTOCOL_PREFIX`. `InstanceManifest` and `HostMintedClaim` types extended.

A developer running Claude Code sees these inline rather than having to grep `~/.claude/` for the gateway's stderr stream. Stderr still receives the same lines for grep-ability — the new channel is additive.

  Closes the last open thread on tesseron#53 — concern (4) called for "plumbing dial outcomes through the MCP `sendLoggingMessage` channel"; this PR ships exactly that. The bridge now declares the `logging` server capability (which a previous version omitted, silently no-op'ing all `sendLoggingMessage` calls). `TesseronGateway` exposes a `'gateway-log'` event and a `GatewayLogEvent` type so embedders that don't use the bundled `McpAgentBridge` can wire the same forwarding into their own MCP server.

Two layers, both addressing concerns left open in tesseron#53 after the single-owner binding fix landed in [#54](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/54):

  **Stale instance manifests are now skipped and tombstoned.** The SDK side (`@tesseron/server`'s WS and UDS transports, `@tesseron/vite`) now stamps `pid: process.pid` on every `~/.tesseron/instances/<id>.json` it writes. The MCP gateway probes `process.kill(pid, 0)` on each manifest before dialing. Manifests whose owning process is gone get unlinked instead of dialed, so a long-running gateway no longer pays a connection-refused round-trip every poll tick for browser tabs whose Vite server died without a clean shutdown. Older SDKs without `pid` are still trusted (no regression for in-flight upgrades). The `InstanceManifest` type in `@tesseron/core` gains an optional `pid?: number` field.

  **Claim codes now carry a cross-gateway ownership breadcrumb.** When the gateway mints a claim code, it writes `~/.tesseron/claims/<CODE>.json` with `{ sessionId, appId, appName, gatewayPid, mintedAt }`. The breadcrumb is removed atomically when the owning gateway claims the session, when an unclaimed session closes, and when the gateway shuts down. When `tesseron__claim_session` is called on a gateway that doesn't own the code locally, it now reads the breadcrumb and surfaces a useful error: `"Claim code XYZ-12 belongs to a different Tesseron gateway (pid 12345, app \"My App\", minted 2026-04-26T15:16:09Z). Switch to the Claude session that opened this connection..."` instead of the previous opaque "No pending session found". If the breadcrumb's gatewayPid is dead, the error reports a stale claim and tombstones the file. This solves the "guess which Claude window owns this code" problem on multi-session developer machines without introducing a cross-process rendezvous protocol.

  `TesseronGateway` exposes a new `describeForeignClaim(code)` method returning `{ kind: 'foreign' | 'stale' | 'unknown', ... }` for embedders that build their own claim UIs, and a new `isPidAlive(pid)` helper export.

- [#62](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/pull/62) [`94d50ef`](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/commit/94d50ef5364ce2a240b5033674d59b0cbe4ca486) Thanks [@KennyVaneetvelde](https://github.com/KennyVaneetvelde)! - Harden every `~/.tesseron/*` write and switch all token generation to the platform CSPRNG. Foundations for tesseron#60 (claim-mediated transport binding); shipped on its own so the security improvements land without waiting for the larger architectural change.

  **Filesystem hygiene.** Instance manifests (`~/.tesseron/instances/<id>.json`) and claim breadcrumbs (`~/.tesseron/claims/<CODE>.json`) are now written via a shared private-file helper that:
  - creates the parent directory with mode `0o700` (and tightens an existing world-readable directory left over from a pre-hardening release);
  - creates the file with mode `0o600` (owner-only read/write);
  - writes atomically via a sibling temp file plus `rename`, so a concurrent reader never observes a partial write.

  A sibling local process running as the same user can no longer enumerate or read the contents of `~/.tesseron/instances/` or `~/.tesseron/claims/` simply by walking the directory. (POSIX modes are advisory on Windows; the parent-dir-as-access-gate model documented for the UDS transport applies there too.)

  **CSPRNG-sourced tokens.** Claim codes (`generateClaimCode`), session IDs (`generateSessionId`), and invocation IDs (`generateInvocationId`) now draw from `crypto.getRandomValues()` with rejection sampling instead of `Math.random()`. The claim code in particular is the user-typed gate between an unclaimed session and the MCP agent — a predictable PRNG meaningfully shrank the ~1.5-billion-combination space against an attacker measuring outputs. The wire format is unchanged (still `XXXX-XX` from a 31-char alphabet); only the entropy source differs.

  **Constant-time compare.** A pure-JavaScript `constantTimeEqual` lands in `@tesseron/core/internal` and replaces the existing `node:crypto` `timingSafeEqual` used to validate `tesseron/resume` tokens. Same security property, but the helper is now reusable from browser-side code paths in upcoming PRs without pulling `node:crypto` into the web bundle.

  No wire-protocol or public-API changes; the new symbols ship under `@tesseron/core/internal` (explicitly not part of the public contract). Existing tests cover unchanged; a new `fs-hygiene.test.ts` exercises mode bits and atomic-write semantics on POSIX, and a new `timing-safe.test.ts` includes a coarse statistical check that catches a regression to a short-circuiting comparison.

### Minor Changes

- [#55](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/pull/55) [`f0e671f`](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/commit/f0e671f1c26195cc597ce90cb2ad8f8f59dd7e9f) Thanks [@KennyVaneetvelde](https://github.com/KennyVaneetvelde)! - Add `tesseron/claimed` notification (gateway → SDK) so apps can clear the spent claim code from their UI once an agent has redeemed it.

  Previously, `useTesseronConnection`'s `claimCode` field reflected whatever was in the welcome forever - the SDK had no way to learn that the code had been consumed. Apps rendering a "Connect Claude" banner would keep showing a dead string, and users would keep trying to type it at the agent (which would correctly reject it as "already claimed", but only after a confusing round-trip).

  The gateway now emits a `tesseron/claimed` notification carrying `{ agent, claimedAt }` when `tesseron__claim_session` succeeds. The SDK patches the cached `WelcomeResult` in place (clearing `claimCode`, updating `agent`) and fires any listener registered via the new `client.onWelcomeChange(...)` API. `@tesseron/react`'s `useTesseronConnection` propagates the change so `connection.claimCode` becomes `undefined` and `connection.welcome.agent` reflects the claiming agent's identity.

  Resolves concern (5) from tesseron#53. No protocol-version bump - this is a new optional notification that older SDKs simply ignore.

Both dialer transports had a bare `catch {}` around `ws.send` / `socket.write` with the comment "socket likely closed; ignore". That defeated the cascade-on-send-failure fix in 2.2.1: the session-dispatcher wrapper in `gateway.ts` was supposed to close the channel when send threw, but the wrapper never saw a throw because the dialer ate it first. The user-visible symptom was `tesseron__read_resource` (and `tesseron__invoke_action`) hanging indefinitely after a Vite HMR cycle that left the gateway-side socket in a `CLOSING` / `CLOSED` state that silently no-op'd subsequent sends.

  Both dialers now let `ws.send` / `socket.write` throws propagate to the dispatcher wrapper, which closes the channel, fires `transport.onClose`, and `rejectAllPending` rejects every outstanding request with `TransportClosedError`.

### Patch Changes

- [#49](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/pull/49) [`db6e0c4`](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/commit/db6e0c4d1a83583c7012634c17d3579bc95060b7) Thanks [@KennyVaneetvelde](https://github.com/KennyVaneetvelde)! - Fix silent hangs when a transport send fails mid-request. Three places used to swallow `transport.send` failures with no signal: the gateway's session-dispatcher wrapper (bare `catch {}`), the SDK client's session-dispatcher wrapper (no try/catch at all), and the Vite plugin's gateway-to-browser bridge (silently dropped frames when `browserWs.readyState !== OPEN`). When a response failed to send, the peer's pending request would wait forever - the user-visible symptom was `tesseron__read_resource` hanging indefinitely after a Vite HMR cycle that left the browser WebSocket in a non-OPEN state.

  All three paths now close the channel on send failure so the peer's `transport.onClose` handler fires, `rejectAllPending` rejects every outstanding request with `TransportClosedError`, and the bridge / MCP tool surfaces a real error instead of hanging. Also reverts the 30s `DEFAULT_RESOURCE_READ_TIMEOUT_MS` band-aid added in [#47](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/47) - it would have papered over genuine hangs by silently failing legitimate slow reads, and the cascade-on-send-failure fix is what actually addresses the root cause.

  `JsonRpcDispatcher.receive()` no longer leaves `handleRequest` rejections as unhandled promise rejections - the transport wrappers now handle the recovery, so we attach an empty `.catch` to suppress noise.

  The documented `.input(z.object({...}))` idiom previously shipped every action
  with a permissive `{type: 'object', additionalProperties: true}` because no
  auto-derivation existed in `@tesseron/core` — only the explicit-second-arg
  path was wired up. Agents got no field-type signal, which meant Claude
  sometimes JSON-encoded numeric arguments as strings; Zod's runtime then
  correctly rejected the call with `-32004 InputValidation`.

  `ActionBuilder.input` / `.output` and `ResourceBuilder.output` now look for a
  JSON Schema exporter on the validator and use it when the caller didn't pass
  one explicitly. Detection is duck-typed and never throws — failures fall
  through to the existing permissive default:
  - **Zod 4+** — `schema.toJSONSchema()` instance method.
  - **TypeBox** — schema object IS the JSON Schema; `~standard` is stripped.
  - **ArkType** — `schema.toJsonSchema()` instance method.
  - **Valibot / Effect Schema / Zod 3** — no native instance exporter; pass
    JSON Schema as the second argument (use `@valibot/to-json-schema`,
    `@effect/schema/JSONSchema`, or `zod-to-json-schema` respectively).

  after an HMR-driven reconnect.

  Two interlocking bugs:
  1. `TesseronClient.connect()` swapped in a new transport without closing the
     previous one, so the old `WebSocket` lingered as a phantom claimed
     session on the gateway side. `connect()` now closes any previously-
     attached transport before swapping, and the per-transport `onClose`
     handler guards against a late close from the prior transport trampling
     the new dispatcher / welcome.
  2. `McpAgentBridge` resolved sessions by `Map`-iteration order, so when the
     user reclaimed via a fresh socket the bridge still routed reads and
     action invocations to the older — and now dead — session. The lookup
     now picks the most-recently-claimed session matching the `app.id`.

### Minor Changes

- [#37](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/pull/37) [`f49f5bf`](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/commit/f49f5bfcf11904b1c98a2b17c14ec89acbeb824a) Thanks [@KennyVaneetvelde](https://github.com/KennyVaneetvelde)! - Multi-binding transport layer (PROTOCOL_VERSION → 1.1.0). Decouples the
  protocol from WebSocket so apps that can host other duplex channels — Unix
  domain sockets, future named pipes / stdio — speak Tesseron without bridging
  through a WS server.

  Closes [#28](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/28), [#29](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/29), [#30](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/30), [#31](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/31), [#32](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/32), [#33](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/33), [#34](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/issues/34).

  ### Protocol
  - New on-disk discovery format: `~/.tesseron/instances/<instanceId>.json`,
    v2 manifest with a discriminated `transport: { kind, ... }` field.
  - New types in `@tesseron/core`: `TransportSpec`, `InstanceManifest`.
  - `PROTOCOL_VERSION` bumped 1.0.0 → 1.1.0. Hard reject on major mismatch,
    warn on minor (covered by `protocol-version.test.ts`).
  - Compat: gateway reads both `instances/` (v2) and `tabs/` (v1) for one
    minor version. v1 manifests are coerced to `{ kind: 'ws', url }`. The
    legacy directory drops in 2.0.

  ### Bindings
  - **WebSocket** (default, unchanged on the wire) — formal binding spec at
    `/protocol/transport-bindings/ws/`.
  - **Unix domain socket** (new) — NDJSON framing on AF_UNIX sockets; SDK-side
    `UnixSocketServerTransport` in `@tesseron/server` (Linux + macOS).
    Same-UID enforcement via 0700 parent dir + 0600 socket file. Select with
    `tesseron.connect({ transport: 'uds' })`. Windows tracked separately —
    Node's `net.listen({ path })` binds named pipes there, which need a
    different binding.

  ### Gateway
  - `TesseronGateway.connectToApp(instanceId, spec: TransportSpec)` —
    signature change from `(tabId, wsUrl)`. Picks a dialer (`WsDialer`,
    `UdsDialer`) by `spec.kind`. Custom dialers can be registered via
    `new TesseronGateway({ dialers: [...] })`.
  - `TesseronGateway.watchInstances()` — replaces `watchAppsJson()`, which
    stays as a deprecated alias for one minor.
  - Internal `Session.ws: WebSocket` → `Session.transport: Transport`. Session
    shutdown now goes through the binding-neutral `transport.close(reason)`
    instead of a raw `ws.close(1001)` — UDS sessions don't have close codes.

  ### Vite plugin
  - `@tesseron/vite` writes v2 instance manifests (`{ kind: 'ws', url }`)
    instead of v1 tab files.
  - Internal `tabId` → `instanceId` (manifests are still per-tab; the rename
    drops the WS-only bias).

  ### Docs
  - `protocol/transport.md` rewritten as a binding-neutral overview.
  - New per-binding pages: `protocol/transport-bindings/ws.md`,
    `protocol/transport-bindings/uds.md`.
  - `sdk/porting.md` updated to describe how to write a new binding.
  - Cross-references in `handshake.mdx`, `wire-format.mdx`, `security.mdx`,
    `mcp.md`, `server.md`, `vite.md`, `quickstart.mdx`, `architecture.mdx`,
    `core.md`, `index.mdx` synced.

### Major Changes

The gateway is now a pure WebSocket client; apps host their own endpoints and announce themselves via `~/.tesseron/tabs/<tabId>.json`. One discovery mechanism for every runtime, no fixed ports.

  Breaking changes:
  - **`@tesseron/mcp`**: removed `gateway.start()`, `GatewayOptions.port` / `host` / `originAllowlist`, `DEFAULT_GATEWAY_PORT`, `DEFAULT_GATEWAY_HOST`, and the `TESSERON_PORT` / `TESSERON_HOST` / `TESSERON_ORIGIN_ALLOWLIST` environment variables. The CLI now watches `~/.tesseron/tabs/` exclusively.
  - **`@tesseron/server`**: `NodeWebSocketTransport` (a WS client) replaced with `NodeWebSocketServerTransport` (a WS server that binds loopback and writes a tab file). `DEFAULT_GATEWAY_URL` removed. `tesseron.connect()` no longer accepts a gateway URL string; pass `NodeWebSocketServerTransportOptions` (`appName`, `host`, `port`) or a custom `Transport`.
  - **`@tesseron/web`**: `DEFAULT_GATEWAY_URL` now derives from `location.origin` and points at `/@tesseron/ws` (served by the new `@tesseron/vite` plugin). Production-browser SPAs that previously dialed `ws://localhost:7475` must provide their own bridge.

  New packages:
  - **`@tesseron/vite`**: Vite plugin that exposes `/@tesseron/ws` on the dev server and bridges browser tabs to the gateway.
  - **`@tesseron/svelte`** and **`@tesseron/vue`**: framework adapters with lifecycle-scoped `tesseronAction` / `tesseronResource` / `tesseronConnection`.

  Required migration:
  - Browser apps: add `@tesseron/vite` to `devDependencies` and register `tesseron()` in `vite.config.ts`.
  - Node apps: no env vars or URLs to configure; `tesseron.connect()` handles bind-and-announce automatically.

### Minor Changes

- [#6](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/pull/6) [`3e8ee2f`](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/commit/3e8ee2fd431f37c952fff376a3f5bb5202ff870c) Thanks [@KennyVaneetvelde](https://github.com/KennyVaneetvelde)! - Surface `TesseronErrorCode` in tool-call error results. The bridge's
  `errorResult` helper now returns an MCP-spec-native `structuredContent`
  object carrying the underlying `TesseronError`'s numeric `code` (and `data`,
  when present), so agents can programmatically branch on `TransportClosed`
  vs `HandlerError` vs `InputValidation` etc. instead of regex-matching the
  text body. The structured shape is exported from `@tesseron/core` as
  `TesseronStructuredError` for typed consumer access.

  Before:

  ```jsonc
  // tools/call response for a failed invocation
  {
    "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Invalid input\n[...]" }],
    "isError": true,
  }
  ```

  After:

  ```jsonc
  {
    "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Invalid input\n{\n  \"code\": -32004,\n  \"data\": [...]\n}" }],
    "structuredContent": { "code": -32004, "data": [...] },
    "isError": true
  }
  ```

  The text body stays backwards-compatible (it still embeds the same shape
  as `${message}\n${JSON}`), so existing log-scraping / regex assertions
  keep passing. `structuredContent` is an optional field in
  `CallToolResultSchema` from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, so MCP clients
  that ignore it are unaffected.

  Call sites in `mcp-bridge.ts` now pass the full `TesseronError` to
  `errorResult` rather than extracting `error.data` at the caller.

  transport drop (tab refresh, network blip, HMR) without going through the
  6-character claim-code dance again.

  **Protocol** (`@tesseron/core`)
  - `WelcomeResult.resumeToken` now carries an opaque, cryptographically-random
    token the caller can stash to rejoin this session later.
  - New `tesseron/resume` method with `{ sessionId, resumeToken }` params plus
    the same manifest fields as `tesseron/hello` (a fresh app build may have
    added, removed, or changed actions/resources since last connect).
  - New `TesseronErrorCode.ResumeFailed` (`-32011`) covers unknown session,
    expired zombie, unclaimed zombie, and bad-token failures.

  **Gateway** (`@tesseron/mcp`)
  - New `GatewayOptions.resumeTtlMs` (default 90 s). Closed sessions are
    retained as zombies for this window and can be resumed via
    `tesseron/resume`. Set to `0` to disable resume entirely.
  - Constant-time token compare via `crypto.timingSafeEqual` with a length
    pre-check.
  - Tokens are one-shot: every successful resume rotates the token.

  **SDK** (`@tesseron/core`, `@tesseron/server`, `@tesseron/web`)
  - `TesseronClient.connect(transport, options?)` and the URL-string overloads
    on `ServerTesseronClient` / `WebTesseronClient` accept a new optional
    `{ resume: { sessionId, resumeToken } }` argument. When present, the SDK
    sends `tesseron/resume` instead of `tesseron/hello`.
  - `ConnectOptions` and `ResumeCredentials` exported from `@tesseron/core`.

  **Storage policy**

  Storage of the `{ sessionId, resumeToken }` pair is the implementer's
  responsibility. The SDK exposes the primitive; apps decide where the token
  lives (localStorage, cookie, Electron store, OS keychain, etc). A four-line
  recipe for the browser sits in `docs/protocol/resume`; it is intentionally
  not a shipped feature of `@tesseron/web`.

  Backwards-compatible: older gateways that never populated `resumeToken`
  continue to work, and SDKs that don't pass `{ resume }` send `tesseron/hello`
  exactly as before.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`3e8ee2f`](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/commit/3e8ee2fd431f37c952fff376a3f5bb5202ff870c), [`97248fb`](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/commit/97248fbce9f5b0f1e2d065390ccbd50fa92b6ea7)]:
  - @tesseron/core@1.1.0
  - @tesseron/server@1.1.0

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- [#3](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/pull/3) [`2445125`](https://github.com/eigenwise/tesseron/commit/2445125df8e7673227bbcdf922a0b7d8b276b7f0) Thanks [@KennyVaneetvelde](https://github.com/KennyVaneetvelde)! - Fix hang on session WebSocket disconnect: the gateway now rejects all pending
  dispatcher requests (`actions/invoke`, `resources/read`, `resources/subscribe`,
  `resources/unsubscribe`) with a `TransportClosedError` when a session's socket
  closes, mirroring the SDK-side behaviour. Previously, in-flight requests
  abandoned by a disappearing SDK would hang until the MCP client's own timeout
  kicked in.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Expanded each package's README to be a proper npm landing page. Each
  now shows the Tesseron logo, a package-specific tagline, install
  command, quick-start code example, what-you-get bullet list, pairing
  guidance, doc links (main repo + SDK reference + protocol spec +
  examples), license summary, and Eigenwise attribution. The previous
  two-line descriptions left visitors landing on npm without enough
  context to know what they were looking at or how to use it.

  No code changes, no API changes — this is purely a docs release so the
  npm package pages match the quality of the GitHub README.

- Updated dependencies []:
  - @tesseron/core@1.0.1
  - @tesseron/server@1.0.1

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- Initial public release of Tesseron (v1.0.0) under Business Source License 1.1.

  Protocol version bumped to `1.0.0` to align with the SDK release. Packages
  are published with stable API surfaces — future 1.x releases follow
  semantic versioning.

  Highlights:
  - Typed action builder with Zod / Standard Schema input validation.
  - Subscribable resources with tag support.
  - Handler context: `ctx.confirm`, `ctx.elicit` (schema-validated),
    `ctx.sample`, `ctx.progress`, structured errors
    (`SamplingNotAvailableError`, `ElicitationNotAvailableError`).
  - MCP gateway bridges JSON-RPC/WS to MCP/stdio. Three tool-surface
    modes (`dynamic`, `meta`, `both`) for client compatibility.
  - `tesseron__read_resource` meta-tool for MCP clients without native
    resource support.
  - 65 tests across `@tesseron/core` and `@tesseron/mcp`.
  - Reference implementation: BUSL-1.1 (auto-converts to Apache-2.0
    four years post-release). Protocol specification: CC BY 4.0.
